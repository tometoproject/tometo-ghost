	<p class="measure lh-copy f4">
		It's a website that you can open on your browser or your phone. Unlike Twitter
		or other social networks, you create a "character" that will speak your status updates
		using text-to-speech technology! You can adjust the pitch and tone of your character's
		voice, and eventually, the site will be host to a lot of different other things
		you can do with your character as well!

	<p class="measure lh-copy f4">
		Tometo is currently in <strong>active development</strong>! At this point
		there's no public beta or alpha, although we will certainly update this website
		once we get to that point. We also can't give any timeframe on when we'll get to
		that milestone. However, it is developed as source-available software,
		the source is available <a href="https://marie.marisa.cloud/t/tometo" class="link blue">here</a>.
